## Description

Hell is an interpreted, statically-typed, shell scripting language
based on Haskell.

It's a WIP.

### Informal description

See `examples/` for a list of example scripts.

Example program:

```haskell
main = do
  Text.putStrLn "Please enter your name and hit ENTER:"
  name :: Text <- Text.getLine
  Text.putStrLn "Thanks, your name is: "
  Text.putStrLn name
```

### Design philosophy

Turtle, Shelly, shell-conduit and Shh are "do shell scripting in
Haskell", but lack something. GHC is a large dependency to require for
running scripts, and the Haskell ecosystem is not capable of the
stability required. Scripts written in them are brittle and clunky.

My definition of a shell scripting language:

* A small interpreted language capable of launching processes
* No abstraction or re-use capabilities from other
  files/modules/packages
* Small, portable binary
* Stable, does not change in backwards-incompatible ways

Hell satisfies these criteria.

The other design decisions are:

* Use existing Haskell naming convention, don't rename things for the
  sake of it. Even if the names Haskell chose aren't great, or are
  long.
* Lean on and re-use concepts in the host system, even if they're
  flawed. Haskell's standard libraries get a lot of things right, and
  some things wrong. But stick to the intuitions that already are
  there where possible.
* Don't break common shell understanding. Current directory and
  environment variables are process-wide, even if one would prefer
  otherwise. If you want "local" directories, carry a path around.
* Use established API patterns that already work. (In particular this
  applies to the process launching API, which "script in Haskell"
  always tend to re-invent. I'm just re-using the API of
  typed-process.)

One exception to this rule is avoiding `type String`. Sorry, it's hard
to justify when `Text` is established.

### More formal description

* The language is a simply-typed lambda calculus, with Haskell syntax.
* Some primitives that can be polymorphic (but require immediately
  applied type applications).
* Polymorphic primitives such as `id` require passing the type of the
  argument as `id @Int 123`. You cannot define polymorphic lambdas of
  your own. It's not full System-F.
* Recursion is not supported. Use `Fun.fix`.
* It will support type-classes (for equality, dictionaries, etc), but
  the dictionaries must be explicitly supplied. You can't define
  classes, or data types, of your own.
* The types and functions available lean directly on the host language
  (Haskell) and are either directly lifted, or a simplified layer over
  the original things.
* There is presently no type inference (but I will add it). All
  parameters of lambdas, or do-notation let bindings, must have their
  type declared via a pattern signature: `\(x :: Int) -> x`
* Globals of any kind must be fully qualified (`Main.foo` and
  `Text.putstrLn`), including the current module.

## Instructions

### Running

Presently the `hell` binary type-checks and interprets immediately a
program in `IO`.

    $ hell examples/01-hello-world.hell
    Hello, World!

See https://github.com/chrisdone/hell/releases for a statically-linked
amd64 Linux binary.

### Building

Build statically for Linux in a musl distribution:

    stack build --ghc-options="-static -optl-static"
